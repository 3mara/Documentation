In this chapter we tried to evaluate the performance of the system, the rest of the chapter is organized as follows the dataset and challenges are listed in section ~\ref{sec:challenges}, while the evaluation techniques are disucssed in section ~\ref{sec:tech}, finally section ~\ref{sec:results} shows the results obtained.

\section{Challenges}\label{sec:challenges}
However Arabic language is used by more than $330$ million Arabic speakers, there are few systems that we can compare our system with, also there are no human-judged dataset for Arabic text. We used Aljazeera data set \footnote[1]{Available online at http://filebox.vt.edu/users/dsaid/AljNews.tar.gz} that is categorized in to $8$ categories to measure the accurace of the different clustering algorithms.

Running the different algorithms on the our computers capabilities consumes too long time so we didn't manage running too many data sets with different parameters.
